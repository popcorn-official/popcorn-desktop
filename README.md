We need all the help we can get! You can also join our [community](README.md#community) to keep up-to-date and meet other developers.

## Getting Started

If you're comfortable getting up and running from a `git clone`, this method is for you.

If you clone the GitHub repository, you will need to build a number of assets using grunt.

The [master](https://github.com/popcorn-official/popcorn-desktop) branch which contains the latest release.

#### Quickstart:

1. `gulp run`

If you encounter trouble with the above method, you can try:

1. `npm install -g bower gulp` (Linux: you may need to run with `sudo`)

2. `npm install`
3. `bower install`
4. `gulp build`
5. `gulp run`

Optionally, you may simply run `./make_popcorn.sh` if you are on a linux or mac based operating system.

## Versioning

For transparency and insight into our release cycle, and for striving to maintain backward compatibility, Popcorn Time will be maintained according to the [Semantic Versioning](http://semver.org/) guidelines as much as possible.

Releases will be numbered with the following format:

`<major>.<minor>.<patch>-<build>`

Constructed with the following guidelines:

* A new *major* release indicates a large change where backward compatibility is broken.
* A new *minor* release indicates a normal change that maintains backward compatibility.
* A new *patch* release indicates a bugfix or small change which does not affect compatibility.
* A new *build* release indicates this is a pre-release of the version.
