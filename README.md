## Install

### Windows:
Download and install:
  * **Latest release**: check [popcorntime.app](https://popcorntime.app/#get-app) or the repo's [releases page](https://github.com/popcorn-official/popcorn-desktop/releases)
  * Or **latest dev build (for testers)**: check the repo's [actions page](https://github.com/popcorn-official/popcorn-desktop/actions)


### MacOS:
Download and install:
  * **Latest release**: check [popcorntime.app](https://popcorntime.app/#get-app) or the repo's [releases page](https://github.com/popcorn-official/popcorn-desktop/releases)
  * Or **latest dev build (for testers)**: check the repo's [actions page](https://github.com/popcorn-official/popcorn-desktop/actions)

Easily install Popcorn Time via _[Homebrew](https://brew.sh) ([Cask](https://docs.brew.sh/Cask-Cookbook)):_
  ~~~ rb
  brew tap popcorn-official/popcorn-desktop https://github.com/popcorn-official/popcorn-desktop.git
  #export HOMEBREW_POPCORN_TIME_BUILD=false
  brew install --cask popcorn-time #--no-quarantine
  ~~~

By default, this will build the app from source using the latest version of [NW.js](https://nwjs.io) on macOS 12.x (Monterey) or later, else revert to the [latest](https://github.com/popcorn-official/popcorn-desktop/releases/latest) stable build on previous versions of macOS. This behaviour can also be forced by `export`ing a `HOMEBREW_POPCORN_TIME_BUILD=false` [environment variable](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Environment_variable), for example in `~/.bashrc` or `~/.zshrc`.

Also, if you keep a [_Brewfile_](https://github.com/Homebrew/homebrew-bundle#usage), you can add something like this:
  ~~~ rb
  repo = "popcorn-official/popcorn-desktop"
  tap repo, "https://github.com/#{repo}.git"
  #ENV["HOMEBREW_POPCORN_TIME_BUILD"] = "false"
  cask "popcorn-time" #, args: { "no-quarantine": true }
  ~~~


### Linux - Debian/Ubuntu based distros:
Download and install:
  * **Latest release**: check [popcorntime.app](https://popcorntime.app/#get-app) or the repo's [releases page](https://github.com/popcorn-official/popcorn-desktop/releases)
  * Or **latest dev build (for testers)**: check the repo's [actions page](https://github.com/popcorn-official/popcorn-desktop/actions)

Via .deb package:

  _**Firstly, be aware** in some cases, missings dependencies packages (libatomic1, libgconf-2-4, libcanberra-gtk-module) were reported to be required for the app to works.  
  **If the app don't start for you too**, in this case, **try `sudo apt update && sudo apt install libatomic1 libgconf-2-4 libcanberra-gtk-module`** to be sure your system have the required dependencies._

Via archive and command line (tested on ubuntu 18.04 and 20.04):
  1. Download Popcorn Time archive:  
      * For the **latest release**:  
      `wget -c https://get.popcorntime.app/repo/build/Popcorn-Time-0.4.8-linux64.zip`  
  _if eventually you get issue with popcorntime.app website you can try to download from the github repo  
  `wget -c https://github.com/popcorn-official/popcorn-desktop/releases/download/v0.4.8/Popcorn-Time-0.4.8-linux64.zip`_
  2. Create popcorn-time folder in /opt/:  
  `sudo mkdir /opt/popcorn-time`  
  3. Install unzip && dependencies (they should not be always required but some users needed them to make Popcorn Time working):  
  `sudo apt update && sudo apt install unzip libcanberra-gtk-module libgconf-2-4 libatomic1`  
  4. Extract the zip in /opt/popcorn-time:  
  `sudo unzip Popcorn-Time-0.4.8-linux64.zip -d /opt/popcorn-time`  
  5. Create symlink of Popcorn-Time in /usr/bin:  
  `sudo ln -sf /opt/popcorn-time/Popcorn-Time /usr/bin/popcorn-time`  
  6. Create .desktop file (so the launcher):  
  `sudo nano /usr/share/applications/popcorntime.desktop`  
  7. and copy paste the following text in the editor and save  
  ```desktop
  [Desktop Entry]
  Version = 1.0
  Type = Application
  Terminal = false
  Name = Popcorn Time
  Exec = /usr/bin/popcorn-time
  Icon = /opt/popcorn-time/src/app/images/icon.png
  Categories = Application;
  ```


## Getting Started

If you're comfortable getting up and running from a `git clone`, this method is for you.

The [development](https://github.com/popcorn-official/popcorn-desktop/tree/development) branch contains the latest changes.  
The [master](https://github.com/popcorn-official/popcorn-desktop/tree/master) branch contains the latest release.

#### Quickstart:

1. `yarn start`

If you encounter trouble with the above method, you can try:

1. `yarn config set yarn-offline-mirror ./node_modules/`
2. `yarn install --ignore-engines`
3. `yarn build`
4. `yarn start`

Optionally, you may simply run `./make_popcorn.sh` if you are on a linux or mac based operating system.

Full instructions & troubleshooting tips can be found in the [Contributing Guide](CONTRIBUTING.md#contributing-to-popcorn-time).

#### Building redistribuable packages/installers:

1. `yarn config set yarn-offline-mirror ./node_modules/`

* A new *patch* release indicates a bugfix or small change which does not affect compatibility.
* A new *build* release indicates this is a pre-release of the version.
